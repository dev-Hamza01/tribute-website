                <h2>The Flame of Indian Revolution</h2>
                <p><b>Bhagat Singh</b> was Born on 28 September 1907 in Banga, Punjab (now in Pakistan), Bhagat Singh
                    was raised in a family
                    deeply involved in the Indian independence movement. Influenced by stories of bravery and patriotism
                    from an early age, he was drawn toward revolutionary ideas and the vision of a free India. His mind
                    matured quickly, and by his teens, he was already immersed in nationalist activities, challenging
                    colonial rule with his sharp intellect and pen.</p>
